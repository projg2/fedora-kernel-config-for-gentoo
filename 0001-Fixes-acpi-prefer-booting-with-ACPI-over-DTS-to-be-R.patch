Subject: [PATCH] Fixes "acpi: prefer booting with ACPI over DTS" to be RHEL
 only

The ACPI prefernce is RHEL specific, in Fedora we use upstream defaults so
it doesn't randomly change the expectations as to how certain hardware works
that generally isn't classed as "enterprise". So wrap it in the special RHEL
check as it should be for the ARK kernels.
